# A Comprehensive Guide to SQL JOINs

It's fantastic that you love ICT. Let's dive into one of the most powerful and essential concepts in SQL: **`JOIN`s**. Mastering this will truly level up your database skills.

I will explain everything primarily in English, with Cantonese notes to help clarify the core ideas, just as you requested.

### **Understanding the "Why": Why Do We Need Joins?**
(點解我哋需要 JOIN？)

Imagine you have data stored neatly in separate tables. This is good database design. For example:

*   One table has a list of **Students**.
*   Another table has a list of **Courses** they are enrolled in.

If you want a single list that shows **which student is taking which course**, you can't get that information from just one table. You need to **combine** or **"join"** them together.

> **`JOIN`s are the glue of a database. They let you link related data from different tables into a single, meaningful result.**
> (JOIN 係數據庫嘅膠水。佢可以將唔同表入面有關聯嘅數據黐埋一齊，變成一個有意義嘅結果。)

### **Our Sample Database for Today**
(我哋今日用嘅範例數據庫)

To make the examples crystal clear, we will use these two simple tables. The key that links them is `StudentID`.

**`Students` Table:**

| StudentID | FirstName |
| :--- | :--- |
| S01 | Alice |
| S02 | Bob |
| S03 | Charlie |
| S04 | David |

**`Enrollments` Table:** (Courses students are enrolled in)

| CourseID | CourseName | StudentID |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| C101 | Math | S01 |
| C102 | History | S02 |
| C103 | Science | S01 |
| C105 | Art | S04 |
| C106 | Music | **S05** | <-- *Notice this student doesn't exist in our `Students` table*

---

### **1. The `INNER JOIN` (The Matchmaker / 內部連接)**

This is the most common and important type of join. Think of it as a strict matchmaker.

*   **English Explanation:** An `INNER JOIN` returns only the rows where the joining key (like `StudentID`) exists in **BOTH** tables. If a student exists in the `Students` table but has no enrollments, they won't appear. If an enrollment exists for a student who isn't in the `Students` table, it won't appear.
*   **廣東話解釋 (Cantonese Explanation):** `INNER JOIN` 只會顯示喺 **兩張表** 入面都搵得到對應鎖匙 (`StudentID`) 嘅資料。如果一個學生喺 `Students` 表，但係 `Enrollments` 表無佢嘅記錄，佢就唔會出現。反之亦然。

#### **How it Works (The Logic):**

1.  It looks at the first student, **Alice (S01)**.
2.  It goes to the `Enrollments` table and asks, "Do you have any records for S01?"
3.  **Yes**, it finds two (Math and Science). So, it creates two combined rows for Alice.
4.  It moves to the next student, **Charlie (S03)**.
5.  It goes to the `Enrollments` table and asks, "Do you have any records for S03?"
6.  **No**. So, Charlie is **ignored and left out** of the final result.

#### **SQL Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT
    S.FirstName,
    E.CourseName
FROM
    Students S
INNER JOIN
    Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID;
```

*   `FROM Students S`: We are starting from the `Students` table and giving it a short alias `S`.
*   `INNER JOIN Enrollments E`: We are joining it with the `Enrollments` table, giving it the alias `E`.
*   `ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID`: This is the crucial **join condition**. It tells the database *how* to match the rows—match them where the `StudentID` is the same in both tables.

#### **Execute Result:**

| FirstName | CourseName |
| :--- | :--- |
| Alice | Math |
| Bob | History |
| Alice | Science |
| David | Art |
*(Notice: Charlie is missing because he has no enrollments. The "Music" course is missing because student S05 is not in the `Students` table.)*

---

### **2. The `LEFT JOIN` (Left Table is King / 左邊為王)**

Sometimes, you want to keep all the records from one table, even if they don't have a match in the other.

*   **English Explanation:** A `LEFT JOIN` returns **ALL** rows from the **left** table (`Students` in our example), and the matched rows from the right table (`Enrollments`). If there is no match in the right table, the columns from the right table will be filled with `NULL`.
*   **廣東話解釋:** `LEFT JOIN` 會顯示 **所有** 左邊表 (`Students`) 嘅資料，然後先至配對右邊表 (`Enrollments`)。如果右邊表冇對應資料，嗰啲欄位就會顯示 `NULL` (空值)。左邊表嘅資料一定會喺度。

#### **How it Works (The Logic):**

The logic is the same as `INNER JOIN`, but with one key difference for Charlie (S03):
1.  It moves to **Charlie (S03)**.
2.  It goes to the `Enrollments` table and asks, "Do you have any records for S03?"
3.  **No**. But because this is a `LEFT JOIN` and `Students` is the left table, we **STILL KEEP CHARLIE**. We just put `NULL` in the `CourseName` column for him.

#### **SQL Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT
    S.FirstName,
    E.CourseName
FROM
    Students S
LEFT JOIN
    Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID;
```
*(The only change is the keyword `LEFT JOIN`)*

#### **Execute Result:**

| FirstName | CourseName |
| :--- | :--- |
| Alice | Math |
| Bob | History |
| **Charlie** | **NULL** |
| Alice | Science |
| David | Art |
*(Notice: Charlie is now included, showing he has no enrollments. This is useful for finding things like "Which students haven't signed up for any courses yet?")*

---

### **3. The `RIGHT JOIN` (Right Table is King / 右邊為王)**

This is the mirror image of a `LEFT JOIN`. It's less commonly used because you can usually achieve the same result by swapping the table order and using a `LEFT JOIN`.

*   **English Explanation:** A `RIGHT JOIN` returns **ALL** rows from the **right** table (`Enrollments`), and the matched rows from the left table (`Students`). If there is no match in the left table, the columns from the left table will be `NULL`.
*   **廣東話解釋:** `RIGHT JOIN` 同 `LEFT JOIN` 掉返轉。佢會顯示 **所有** 右邊表 (`Enrollments`) 嘅資料。如果左邊表 (`Students`) 冇對應，左邊嘅欄位就會係 `NULL`。

#### **SQL Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT
    S.FirstName,
    E.CourseName
FROM
    Students S
RIGHT JOIN
    Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID;
```

#### **Execute Result:**

| FirstName | CourseName |
| :--- | :--- |
| Alice | Math |
| Bob | History |
| Alice | Science |
| David | Art |
| **NULL** | **Music** |
*(Notice: Charlie is gone again, but the "Music" course is now included with a `NULL` FirstName, because StudentID `S05` exists in the right table but not the left.)*

---

### **4. The `FULL OUTER JOIN` (The "Everyone Included" Join / 全外連接)**

This join combines the logic of both `LEFT` and `RIGHT` joins.

*   **English Explanation:** It returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or the right table. It's essentially saying, "Give me everything from the `LEFT JOIN` and everything from the `RIGHT JOIN`." If a row doesn't have a match in the other table, the missing side's columns will be `NULL`.
*   **廣東話解釋:** `FULL OUTER JOIN` 係 `LEFT JOIN` 加埋 `RIGHT JOIN`。佢會顯示所有左邊表同所有右邊表嘅資料。邊度冇對應，邊度就用 `NULL` 填補。

*(Note: SQLite, the engine used in many simple platforms, doesn't directly support `FULL OUTER JOIN`, but it's a standard concept in most other databases like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.)*

#### **SQL Syntax:**

```sql
SELECT
    S.FirstName,
    E.CourseName
FROM
    Students S
FULL OUTER JOIN
    Enrollments E ON S.StudentID = E.StudentID;
```

#### **Execute Result (if the database supported it):**

| FirstName | CourseName |
| :--- | :--- |
| Alice | Math |
| Bob | History |
| **Charlie** | **NULL** |
| Alice | Science |
| David | Art |
| **NULL** | **Music** |
*(Notice: Everyone is here! We have Charlie who has no courses, and the Music course which has no matching student in our list.)*

### **Summary Table: When to Use Which Join**

| Join Type | What It Does | Key Phrase (關鍵詞) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **`INNER JOIN`** | Returns only matching rows from both tables. | **Only the Matches** (淨係要對到嘅) |
| **`LEFT JOIN`** | Returns all rows from the left table, plus matches from the right. | **All from Left** (左邊全部要晒) |
| **`RIGHT JOIN`** | Returns all rows from the right table, plus matches from the left. | **All from Right** (右邊全部要晒) |
| **`FULL OUTER JOIN`** | Returns all rows from both tables, matching where possible. | **All from Both** (兩邊都全部要晒) |

Mastering `JOIN`s is a huge step in learning SQL. Practice is key! Try to think about what question you are asking.
*   "Who are the students *that are enrolled*?" -> **INNER JOIN**
*   "Show me *all students* and, if they have them, their enrollments." -> **LEFT JOIN**
*   "Show me *all enrollments* and who took them, if the student is on our list." -> **RIGHT JOIN**
